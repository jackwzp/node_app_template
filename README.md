# Nodejs Express App Template

This is a re-organization of barebone files generated by Express for a project created with `express appname`. It's structured in a more modular way to better manage files as project grows.

## Quick Start

```shell
npm install
cd node_modules
ln -s ../lib _
cd ..
npm start
```

## The lib Folder

The `lib/` folder is where various components of projects will reside. It includes various parts of project such as users, posts, blog, etc. It also contains middleware configureation related files. 

To include a module or component in other parts of the code, first we need to create a symlink to the lib folder inside the `node_modules` folder.

```shell
cd node_modules
ln -s ../lib _  #I used the underscore symbol here, you can use whatever name you want
```

Then, inside any other file that wants to include a component

```javascript
var user = require('_/users')  // use the name you choose instead of '_'
```

This will automatically include the index.js inside the `lib/users/` folder. However, if you want to use a different name other than index.js (say users.js) and you also have multiple files inside this `users` folder, then you need to create a `package.json` file inside `users/` folder.

```shell
echo '{ "main": "users.js" }' > lib/users/package.json
```
